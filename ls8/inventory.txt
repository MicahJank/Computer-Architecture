ls8 folder contains 3 relevant files for me
- the examples folder
- the cpu.py file
- the ls8.py file


- the examples folder
    - looks like this just contains a bunch of text files showing examples of different cpu instructions for things someone may want to accomplish
    like keyboard input or printing a string etc.





- the cpu.py file
    - contains a class CPU
    - the load function for the class seems to have been implemented
    - the init has nothing in it / unsure if this needs to be filled in with somethign or nothing
    
    
    - the load function
        - has a list containing program instructions
        - has an address counter that increments 1 for every instruction in the program list
        - the function also adds each instruction to a different place in ram using the address counter
        NOTE - the ram has not been added to the CPU yet...could be something that goes in the init?


    - the alu function
        -  a function that takes in 3 parameters op, reg_a, and reg_b
        - looks like its purpose is to perform math calculations on something inside the cpu 'reg' property..
        - self.reg hasnt been defined yet...another thing that may need to go into init?
        - what does reg stand for?
            - i believe register

    - the trace function
        - a prebuilt function that will print out the state of the CPU
    
    - the run function
        - needs to be implemented
        - should run the CPU





- the ls8.py file
    - basically this file creates the cpu using the cpu.py class and then
    runs a load function on that cpu
    finally it runs the cpu
